# Channex Knowledge Graph - Issues to Fix

## Summary
The channex-knowledge-graph project has several TypeScript compilation issues that need to be resolved:

1. **Root level package.json conflict** - FIXED
   - Removed conflicting package.json and node_modules from root directory

2. **TypeScript configuration** - FIXED
   - Updated tsconfig.json to handle both src/ and scripts/ directories
   - Created separate tsconfig.build.json for building only src/
   - Disabled strict unused variable checks for scripts

3. **Import path issues** - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Fixed: channexCodingAgent.ts import paths
   - Remaining: Missing method implementations in channexCodingAgent.ts

4. **MCP Server API changes**
   - The @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v0.5.0 API has changed
   - `setRequestHandler` method no longer exists
   - `connect` method no longer exists

5. **Type issues**
   - Missing type annotations in several files
   - Cheerio.Element type import issue
   - Unused variables and parameters

## How to Run Scripts
Scripts work fine with tsx (TypeScript executor):
```bash
npm run clear:neo4j        # Clear Neo4j database
npm run sync:neo4j         # Sync to Neo4j
npm run parse              # Parse documentation
```

## How to Build
For production build (will show errors that need fixing):
```bash
npm run build
```

## Recommendation
The project works for development and script execution using tsx. The TypeScript compilation errors only affect the production build. These should be fixed when preparing for production deployment, but don't block development work.
