Mapping to Hostelworld is simple, you just need to map all rooms and rate plans.

Hostelworld works with the max occupancy of the room type.

So if there is a Double Room you should send the 2 person price. You cant sell the room for "single occupancy" like with other channels. If there is a 4 person room you should map to a 4 person price.

If it is a dorm room please send price for 1 person
