If you want to test Airbnb please let us know, here are the instructions:

1. Please make an account in Airbnb for your test account, don't use an account with live listings

2. We will need your Airbnb user ID, usually you can find in the URL when you visit your profile page

3. We will add this user as a test user

4. Once that is completed you can make a test listings and it does not get deleted.

5. To book this listing you will need another test user, different to the one that made the listing. Also be sure this is not a live account.


Send the 2 user ID to support@channex.io so we can add as test users.

Make sure you connect your test user to the staging server before you make a listing. Any listings created before connecting will be treated like a normal listing and could get unwanted real bookings.

You can add listings on both accounts and they can book each others listings if you want.
