Once the property is ready to connect please ask the support in the messaging inside the Extranet to connect to Channex or you can do it yourself using their interface.

Feratel mapping can be multi occupancy or per room. If you don't support that you can map the same occupancy to all the different occupancies.

Now you can map the room types from Channex to the Feratel Room types and also any rate plans.

Make sure all is mapped and nothing left unmapped.

Once you save the channel please activate it
