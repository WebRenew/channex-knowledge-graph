Once booking.com connectivity provider is completed or in waiting mode you can start the connection and mapping. If you try before you will get an error since the property has not provided you access yet.

Title: Custom text to call this connection

Property: Choose the correct property from the list

Hotel ID: This is where you enter the property ID of the property from booking.com.

You can find property ID in booking.com extranet at the top of the screen next to the property name.

Test Connection Button - Checks if the property is accessible to map

Once the settings are filled and the test gives a positive result we can move onto the mapping

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/booking.com\#mapping-booking.com)    Mapping booking.com

Mapping is important that all rate plans be mapped, any non mapped rate plans or rooms will cause issues later. If a rate or room is not required anymore then please ask the property to delete it.

![](https://docs.channex.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2514252617-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-LWLG7_BCMgWd3mn6DYg%252F-M9N9xA6YPoq892ZkGms%252F-M9NIdzvM864Ha28za-a%252FScreenshot%25202020-06-09%2520at%252010.59.14.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db0ba4ca2-adb3-425d-b2bd-32cabaa876e5&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=e91a31f9&sv=2)

Notes:

On the left side you will see all the rooms and rates on the channel, and on the right side you can see what is mapped.

The Booking.com room type names are their default name, if you have added a custom name in the extranet then they are not visible. This is why we have also given the Room ID after the text.

Some properties like apartments can have multiple room types of the same name. It will be hard to know how to map unless you look at the ID and match to room internally on the extranet.

Once mapping is completed please save the channel by pressing the save button at the bottom

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/booking.com\#occupancy-based-mapping)    Occupancy Based Mapping

Booking can support occupancy based prices also, if this is supported then you can map each occupancy of a room type

![](https://docs.channex.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2514252617-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-LWLG7_BCMgWd3mn6DYg%252F-MEqfS3SyW-TKGDb5-vS%252F-MEqhQQoapDYJOUgYinE%252FScreenshot%25202020-08-16%2520at%252011.57.45.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D81a5acce-543e-4ea9-ba3a-43d5de1baa29&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=f94058f1&sv=2)

**Primary Rate** \- This will be the rate plan that sends the restrictions such as min stay or stop sell. Since it is only one rate plan in booking.com.

![](https://docs.channex.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2514252617-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-LWLG7_BCMgWd3mn6DYg%252F-MEqfS3SyW-TKGDb5-vS%252F-MEqhrhwQ1I1LNu-2amK%252FScreenshot%25202020-08-16%2520at%252011.57.40.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D39f3622c-eb61-4294-b8b8-496e54bed48c&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=103ce314&sv=2)

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/booking.com\#pull-future-reservations)    Pull Future Reservations

You can also pull all future reservations if you require from booking.com channel. This is useful in many instances especially with a new PMS setup.

Importing bookings will not affect the availability in Channex.

The data you get from imported bookings could lack some details compared to normal booking, it will not include extras, personal data and cleaning fees.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/booking.com\#derived-rate-plans-inside-booking.com)    Derived Rate Plans inside booking.com

Derived should be not mappable inside Channex, if they have some or make new ones inside booking it should work similar to promotions where it does not need mapping and the bookings will come back fine.

However, in some cases there are old versions of derived rates that will show in Channex mapping as mappable rates. There are 2 solutions to this:

1. Map all rates even the derived ones, if you don't map then you will get unmapped booking errors

2. Ask the hotel to delete the derived rates inside booking.com and then they can make them again new. The new versions will not show as mappable and will work as expected.
