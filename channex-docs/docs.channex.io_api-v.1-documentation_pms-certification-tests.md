Please use your staging account credentials to start certification scenarios.

If you cant support anything please make a note in the certification file

Example: We don't support multiple rate plans or We don't support Closed to arrival

Please dont use Postman to complete certification. We always ask for a live screenshare demo to do final testing before going live.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#follow-best-practices)    Follow Best Practices

We have prepared a list of best practices for integration with [Channex](http://channex.io/) Please, read this document and follow provided scenarios at your integration.

[Channex.io Best Practices Guide.](https://docs.channex.io/guides/best-practices-guide)

If your app doesn't support something please just mention you do not support it and move to the next test.

Example: You don't support stop sell so ignore the test for stop sell.

- Room Type API - [https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/room-types-collection#room-types-list](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/room-types-collection#room-types-list)

- Rate Plans API - [https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/rate-plans-collection#rate-plans-list](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/rate-plans-collection#rate-plans-list)


Setup mapping between your system and C [hannex](http://channex.io/)

If possible can you show screenshot of your mapping screen to the test property.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#prepare-your-tests)    Prepare your tests

We have a google form to complete for the certification when you are ready:

[https://forms.gle/xA8F3eSYBPBd8apYA](https://forms.gle/xA8F3eSYBPBd8apYA)

If some test case are not applicable for your integration, please let us know

You will receive a task ID in a successful response from Channex. We need that task ID in the certification form for each test case

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#execute-test-scenarios)    Execute test scenarios

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#id-1.-full-data-update-full-sync)    1\. Full Data Update (Full Sync)

We require a “Full Sync” this would simulate what happens when a Hotel goes “Live” with your integration on our Production Environment.

Full sync means you should send 500 days of Availability, rates and restrictions for all rooms and rates on the property.

We expect the full sync to be 2 API calls:

1 x 500 days for Availability (All Rooms)

1 x 500 days Rates & restrictions (All Rates)

To make sure this is correctly sent in order to certify, the data on the “Test Property” should be similar to that of a Live Hotel with different inventory/rate/restriction values for multiple days of the year. If you are unsure of how to set this up, please let us know so we can advise further.

We don't want to see a full sync with all rooms with 1 availability and 100 USD as example. Better the availability and prices are different like a real hotel.

Once you have sent the “Full Sync”, please attach the returned id(s) generated by our side.

The ID you can find at the response from our side:

Copy

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#id-11.-booking-receiving)    11\. Booking receiving

By using one of our Booking.com test account ( [https://docs.channex.io/guides/test-account-for-booking.com](https://docs.channex.io/guides/test-account-for-booking.com)) create a new channel, setup mapping and launch it. Follow instructions at Test Account For Booking.com page and perform next operations:

- create a new booking (not import)

- modify existed booking

- cancel existed booking


If you get issues with hotel ID already existing let us know and we can remove the other connection.

Be sure, than you send Booking Acknowledge message.

As a results of this test case we expect to receive ID of received Booking and screenshots from your system with this Booking.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#id-12.-rate-limits)    12\. Rate Limits

Please look at proposed rate limits and make sure you have a queue or limiter to not spam our API endpoints. Let us know you can work with these limits

[https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/rate-limits-coming-soon](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/rate-limits-coming-soon)

Can you stay in rate limits?

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#id-13.-update-logic)    13\. Update Logic

We will not accept any logic that just sends full sync on a timer basis

Example: Each 5 mins you send full update of availability for all rooms for 2 years.

We require partners to only send changes to availability and prices.

Full sync is allowed once every 24h if required but please schedule this on off peak hours and try to give some seconds between each property updates if you have a lot of properties to full sync.

Do you agree to only send updated changes to Channex?

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#id-14.-extra-notes)    14\. Extra Notes

- Do you support both Min Stay Through and Arrival? If only one please specify which

- Do you not support the following restrictions? Stop Sell, CTA, CTD etc. Let us know if you don't support any

- Do you support multiple room types and multiple rate plans per room type?

- Do you need credit card details with bookings?

- Are you PCI Certified or use a PCI service like Vaultera, PCI Booking or Tokenex?


## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/pms-certification-tests\#collect-results)    Collect results

When you finish your tests, Please use this form: [https://forms.gle/xA8F3eSYBPBd8apYA](https://forms.gle/xA8F3eSYBPBd8apYA)

In some cases we may require you to update your integration to be more efficient, if all is ok the certification should be successful and we will get back to you with the next steps for production server.
