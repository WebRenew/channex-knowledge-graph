Channex has a full channel API so you can build your own interface to add and map channels. Please ask us directly if you need.

Access to the channel API is only for Whitelabel accounts.

- Add & Delete channels

- Read list of channels

- Channel settings and mappings

- Some OTA specific abilities


Each channel mapping is different so it will take developer time to build mapping for each OTA. We provide a [iframe solution](https://docs.channex.io/api-v.1-documentation/channel-iframe) to make this simpler
