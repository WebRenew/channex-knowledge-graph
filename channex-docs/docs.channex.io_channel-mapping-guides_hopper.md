Hopper is a mobile app that sells flights and hotels via a mobile app, mostly popular in the USA but expanding globally.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/hopper\#how-do-we-sign-up)    How do we sign up?

You can visit their website here to see more information: [https://hotelpartners.hopper.com/](https://hotelpartners.hopper.com/)

OR email them directly here: hotelpartners@hopper.com

You will need to sign an agreement direct with Hopper before your hotel is ready to be sold online

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/hopper\#how-do-i-get-paid)    How do I get Paid?

Hopper works by paying you all bookings via a **Virtual Credit Card**. This means you are guaranteed payments for all bookings generated via Hopper. The commission amount will be negotiated direct but it will be the industry standard amount that you use with other OTA's.

First you need to go to your channels page and create a new channel and search for "Hopper"

Once selected you should go to the mapping page and select which rate plans Hopper can sell. We don't control the cancellation policy via API, this will be done via the contract. Keep it simple and map your Best Available Rates.

Once you have mapped then you can activate the channel.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/hopper\#h_c3bd4952b5)    Net or Gross Model

When you agree to the contract directly with Hopper they will ask you what model you would like to use

Net: You send your prices without commission

Example: If you have a price of $100 to booking and Expedia, you need to give a price to hopper less commission of 15% which is $85 per night.

You can do that easily by putting a discount on the channel i nthe channel settigns and select to decrease by percent and the value of 15.

If you dont give a discount your prices will be too high and you will be unlikely get any bookings.

Gross: You send your commissionable price (This is normal with OTA such as booking and Expedia)

This model you just map your prices and you dont need any discounts.

Remember to email Hopper at hotelpartners@hopper.com if you have not been in touch with them first. The property will not be sold until they have contacted you and the agreements have been signed.
