If the account was previously connected to a PMS for XML API then you will see something like this. The owner or property manager will need to ask VRBO support to convert the account back into a normal account (without channel manager)

Once this is completed it can be ready to connect. Connecting while still connected to previous software can make issues.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/vrbo\#make-sure-you-remove-any-ical-connections)    Make sure you remove any ical connections

Leaving ical connected from Airbnb or another PMS will overwrite anything that Channex sends. You should remove ical connections first.

They should disconnect the current channel manager and convert the account to a normal one with payments by VRBO.
