Once the property is ready to connect please ask the support in the messaging inside the Extranet to connect to Channex or you can do it yourself using their interface.

Make sure you map a Single Room to the HRS single room. Also make sure there is only 1 rate plan per room type. HRS keep availability on the rate plan level so to have multiple rate plans can cause overbookings.

Now you can map the room types from Channex to the HRS Room types and also any rate plans.

Make sure all is mapped and nothing left unmapped.

Once you save the channel please activate it
