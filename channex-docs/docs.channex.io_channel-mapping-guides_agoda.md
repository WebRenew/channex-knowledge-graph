Agoda mapping will always be multi occupancy. If you dont support that you can map the same occupancy to all the different occupancies.

Now you can map the room types from Channex to the Agoda Room types and also any rate plans.

Make sure all is mapped and nothing left unmapped.

Once you save the channel please activate it
