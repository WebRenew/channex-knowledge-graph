### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/properties-and-groups-management\#inventory-days)    Inventory Days

![](https://docs.channex.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2514252617-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-LWLG7_BCMgWd3mn6DYg%252Fuploads%252FiIo5GQZ64mfflGAPzW52%252FScreenshot%25202023-04-18%2520at%252014.21.08.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D753ab194-ffe7-4517-8886-8d8dd5c0caa1&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=86693d6f&sv=2)

This setting controls how many days your inventory will hold. Default is 500 but we can go up to 730 days.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/properties-and-groups-management\#min-stay-settings)    Min Stay Settings

![](https://docs.channex.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2514252617-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-LWLG7_BCMgWd3mn6DYg%252Fuploads%252F5X9MYPbu15YRAf69WtzV%252FScreenshot%25202023-04-18%2520at%252014.22.32.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D52b060c1-2fcb-479e-ac91-9e22dda5f20f&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=e525cc57&sv=2)

This setting will simplify the user experience when you connect a OTA channel. Right now most OTA only support 1 Min stay and you select which one you send. If you set here at the property level then it removes this choice and makes less setting problems and bookings for less nights than expected.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/properties-and-groups-management\#cut-off-time)    Cut Off Time

![](https://docs.channex.io/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2514252617-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-LWLG7_BCMgWd3mn6DYg%252Fuploads%252FRIfJc8KhgzozdrdLA6xj%252FScreenshot%25202023-04-18%2520at%252014.34.48.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D41b2ceb5-1b17-4c81-bd71-2cf72e16a7a5&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=a445d2c2&sv=2)

You can set a time to stop bookings being made for the current night. This is useful for small properties where they don't want last minute bookings in the evening. Once this time hits we change availability to 0 and it cannot be changed unless you turn off the setting.

We change date at 2am property time each night. So if you set at 00 it will stop bookings between Midnight and 2am. If you want to set a 24 hours cut off better to set at 11:30 and 2 days.

A group is a simple field to ask for a name.

The purpose of a group is to collect a number of properties together for viewing or reporting purposes.

A property can be a member of multiple groups

If the property is only a member of one group, the remove options will be disabled. This is because every property must be a member of at least 1 group.
