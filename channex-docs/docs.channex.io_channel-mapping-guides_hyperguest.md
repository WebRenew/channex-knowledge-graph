Reach out to Hyperguest for them to enable the Channex interface.

They should reply with a success and provide you with your property ID. You will use this ID in Channex to connect your property

Mapping is similar with other channels, you map the room type together and then the rate plans.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/hyperguest\#multi-occupancy-note)    Multi Occupancy Note

HyperGuest supports multi occupancy so if you have a 4 person room like the image above you can map a price for each occupancy.

If you have a price per person just map them all here

If you have only a price for the 4 persons then you can map only the 4 person or all of them (like above). Either way is fine.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/hyperguest\#room-rate-codes)    Room/Rate Codes

In HyperGuest extranet you can use any code for your room and rates. I would suggest a readable code to simplify things.

Example: Double Room = DBL-Room

BAR Rate = BAR

It does not matter the codes you use since you will map using the mapping page.

Once you have mapped don't change your codes in HyperGuest. If you do you should remap in Channex.
