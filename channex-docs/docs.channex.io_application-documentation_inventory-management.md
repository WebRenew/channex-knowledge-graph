Generally for hotels and multi unit accommodation businesses you will want to view one property at a time. For vacation rental you will be able to benefit for single or group views.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/inventory-management\#id-2.-pms-connected-properties)    2\. PMS Connected Properties

For properties that have a PMS connected.

The PMS will update to availability, rates and restrictions, changing anything here manually may mean that it is later overwritten by a PMS update.

There are some advanced settings which is likely the PMS does not update:

- Max Availability

- Availability Offset


Copy

```inline-grid min-w-full grid-cols-[auto_1fr] [count-reset:line] print:whitespace-pre-wrap
You can use these special settings to control availability.
Please go here for more details
```

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/inventory-management\#id-3.-inventory-management-overview)    3\. Inventory Management Overview

We use the standard hierarchy of:

- Room Types

- Room Rates

- Channel Rates


#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/inventory-management\#room-type)    **Room Type**

This is the type of room you are selling

**Example:** Double Room, Family Room

Room Types are from the Hotel industry to manage multiple rooms of the same type (Multi Unit)

If you are a vacation rental or sell rooms individually then just call the room type after your property or room.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/inventory-management\#room-rate-rate-plan)    Room Rate / Rate Plan

A room rate is a combo of the Room Type and Rate Plan

**Example:** Double / Best Available Rate

The Room Rate will hold all details of Pricing, Availability and Restrictions for that Room Type.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/inventory-management\#channel-rate)    Channel Rate

A channel rate is when a room rate is mapped to a channel, you will be able to see here what is sent to that channel.

Channel Rate is what is sent to the channel, in channel mapping you can use a modifier to change rates sent to channels.

Example: +10%

In this example the channel rate should show 10% higher than the parent rate.
