## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/application-documentation/change-log-feature\#introduction)    Introduction

The change log has a retention period of 3 months, so if a value has changed in the last 3 months you will be able to find out which user did the changes and the link to the log file.

This feature will mostly be used in times where there is an overbooking or when investigating why a booking may have a cheaper or more expensive price than expected.
