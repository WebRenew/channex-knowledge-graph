Channex is a channel manager system for Property Management Systems (PMS), we provide an API for PMS to connect with Online Travel Agents (OTA) such as Booking.com and Expedia.

The PMS can package a channel manager into it's services or offer as an addon feature.

We are based in the UK and Europe timezone. Any support emails and chats will be answered as soon as possible usually within minutes. If you send out of ours there may be some wait for a reply especially if sent late evening.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/about-channex-and-faq\#why-should-a-pms-use-channex)    Why Should a PMS use Channex?

Nearly all proeprties today need a connection to the OTA. If you don't have direct connections you will need to connect a channel manager. Traditionally the proeprty will buy and pay for a channel manager separately and use with the PMS. By using Channex you can offer this service instead and make extra revenue for your business.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/about-channex-and-faq\#why-choose-channex-over-a-bigger-or-more-famous-company-in-the-space)    Why choose Channex over a bigger or more famous company in the space?

There are a lot of companies that offer channel managers to hotels and vacation rentals, many of which are willing to make a deal for a PMS to white label their software. Channex will be a better choice in most cases (if we have all the channels you require for your market) because:

- Price - We only offer white label services to PMS so our prices are usually unbeatable

- Speed and Tech - We focus on the tech so our upates are in real time and we provide full logs to show the time it took for each update to be sent and received by the OTA.

- API - We offer a full API from creating properties, rooms and rates to mapping each OTA. You can full flexibility and control.

- Self Service - You don't need to ask Channex for help to do anything, you can create properties, map channels, find logs and many other things yourself. No need to wait for us to do anything to get a new proeprty live.

- Fast Tech Support - Since our customers are only PMS systems we can provide fast support, especially if its technical support.
