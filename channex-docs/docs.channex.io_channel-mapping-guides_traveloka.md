Traveloka mapping will always be multi occupancy. If you donÂ´'t support that you can map the same occupancy to all the different occupancies.

Traveloka only support meal plans on the room level so you might have multiple rooms of the same type but with different meal plans.

There will always only be 1 room type to map "RETAIL" only, all other rates are derived from this one

Now you can map the room types from Channex to the Traveloka Room types and also any rate plans.

Make sure all is mapped and nothing left unmapped.

Once you save the channel please activate it

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.channex.io/channel-mapping-guides/traveloka\#with-or-without-tax-commission)    With or without Tax/Commission

We have a setting to get with or without commission you can ask Traveloka to change settings to change without tax or without commission

If hotel wishes to receive the same amount as our hotel voucher, the hotel can contact their Traveloka representative to change the configuration in our extranet so that the amount after tax that we sent in the booking notification will be the same as our hotel voucher.
